  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I have had many blogs. I put up my first blog way back 2010 when a peculiar epiphany about life after death dawned on me when I was in the middle of my favorite hobby - day dreaming. Unfortunately, I am the best example of <em>“Ningas-Kugon”</em>. It is a Tagalog term to describe an attitude of a person who builds up great enthusiasm at the beginning of the project but the fire just doesn’t last long enough to finish the task or sustain the activity. I managed to start several blogs that served as my avenue to share my creative works like poems, lyrics and very few articles about stuffs that interest me but failed to keep the ball rolling for each and every single one of them.</p>

<p>Now I find myself having the same old urge. I am overflowing with eagerness and equipped with a strong determination to be a successful blogger.</p>

<p>This time around, I want to put up a Tech blog. I am a Software engineer by profession and have a great deal of experience in the field. However, most of my efforts are manifested in the workplace. It is a shame that I haven’t accomplished a project of my own. Doesn’t mean I didn’t even attempt to work on anything. I used to have lots of ideas and initiated several projects but I guess you get the gist what happens in the succeeding chapters. It’s the same old <em>“Ningas Kugon”</em> story. It is my goal to overcome this attitude and I have a plan on how to go about it.</p>

<h2 id="so-why-do-a-tech-blog-this-time"><a href="#header-2"></a>So why do a Tech blog this time?</h2>

<p>I will share a couple of my motivations.</p>

<h3 id="to-learn-new-things"><a href="#header-3"></a>To learn new things</h3>
<p>In the field of software development, continuous learning is imperative. Keeping up-to-date with the latest technology is no question getting extremely tricky compared to 10 years ago. It is not just about learning a new programming language. Developers in the recent times have been overwhelmed with a plethora of frameworks, tools, platforms, best practices and techniques that help increase productivity, speed up development, and achieve efficiency in maintaining clusters of systems and applications.</p>

<p>My plan is to share the things that I am learning about or projects that I’m working on. When I write about things with the intention of sharing or teaching it to others, I tend to give more attention to the subject which makes me understand it more deeply. I will aim to deliver it in a fashion wherein a student can easily comprehend. As the famous saying “If you can’t explain it to a six year old, you don’t understand it yourself” rings true to me.</p>

<h3 id="empowerment"><a href="#header-3"></a>Empowerment</h3>
<p>I myself resort to Tech blogs to learn or help me solve a given problem. Tech bloggers have already done the homework for other people. They save other developers of going through all the hassle of exploring different tools by recommending stuffs and showing the ways that already worked for them. I consider reading blogs a highway pass to getting things done. Accomplishing things in shorter amount of time boosts my self-efficacy of which is a major source of my motivation. As grateful as I am, I long to contribute back to the community by making other learners benefit the same way as I have benefitted from the awesome people who diligently devote their time, skills and effort to make other people’s lives easier.</p>

<h3 id="to-improve-technical-writing-skills"><a href="#header-3"></a>To improve technical writing skills</h3>
<p>I just think that technical writing is a valuable skill that a programmer can possess. An API is only as good as its documentation. Developers normally use a tool where documentation is written well enough so that the user easily understands the concepts communicated. It is easier to collaborate with a team if codebases came with proper documentation on how to use, configure, and maintain the application. There is a high chance to pitch an idea to manager/client/stakeholder if information is conveyed effectively. Users are more likely to get around the application without the need of technical support if sufficient documentation is provided. I admit that writing is not one of my strengths. I want to do it more to get better at it.</p>

<h3 id="share-opinions"><a href="#header-3"></a>Share opinions</h3>
<p>Occasionally, I just feel the urge to get something out of my chest. It can be a useful insight, a random opinion, or simply a rant.</p>

<h2 id="the-plan"><a href="#header-2"></a>The plan.</h2>

<h3 id="develop-a-habit"><a href="#header-3"></a>Develop a habit</h3>
<p>One develops a habit if it is done consistently. I plan to deliver the same amount of output in a given timeframe. My goal is to publish atleast 1 post every fortnight.</p>

<h3 id="commit-to-a-schedule"><a href="#header-3"></a>Commit to a schedule</h3>
<p>I will allot my weekends (Friday-Sunday) to my blog works. I can flexibly work any time during those days as long as I conclude something to publish on Monday morning every fortnight. Adhering to such commitment will help me keep my learning pace and enthusiasm in building projects just so I can provide content to my blog.</p>

<p><br /><br /><br />
Yeah, the plan is as simple as that.  Hopefully, it will work out this time. Cheers!</p>
