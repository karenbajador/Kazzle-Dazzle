I’m Karen. Most of my colleagues here in Australia call me ‘Kaz’. Hence the blog title. I am a developer. Maybe one of those who can be referred to as full-stack. Though I can’t say I am specialized in “everything” like the common stereotype for such. I only possess practical knowledge in the process of materializing a concept.  I know a little bit of this and that. I study things as I need it. 

I have vast experience in working on projects related to web development, data engineering, and api integrations. I have recently acquired passion for data.  I am fond of the idea of forming insights out of titanic volumes of unstructured data. I once aspired to be a data scientist but I am currently struggling to learn machine learning. For now, I am focused on strengthening my skills in application development and data engineering. There are so many things I still have to learn in that space.

I put up this blog to write about my journey in learning new things in the realm of technology. I am excited to share about my learning process and challenges in getting stuff done, and probably my insights on random subject of interests.
